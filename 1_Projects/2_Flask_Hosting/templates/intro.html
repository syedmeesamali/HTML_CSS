<p>
    My name is "Syed Meesam Ali Naqvi" and I am an experienced (more than 10 years) "Civil Engineer" by profession. 
    However computer programming had been my passion since childhood from the day I read a book on GW-BASIC and it 
    was an aha moment for me. It was amazing to know that the "magic box" (as my uncle used to call it) could be 
    programmed by anyone with knowledge of programming. 
    I had a small taste of "C" while reading a friend's course book on C-language. Interestingly though it was part of 
    my friend's course-work but he had no interest in it while I was enjoying it and surprisingly at one point I was
    teaching him "C-Language (Turbo-C compiler)".
</p>

<p>
    Things changed when I joined university and opted for a course of "Civil Engineering" instead of "Computer Science"
    as the former had better job prospects (back in 2005). I was the most excited one while taking course on Visual Basic in
    my university's first year. We built a simple calculator and I was helping most of my mates who were totally new to 
    programming and didn't enjoy it much. 
    Later during the course I was disconnected from programming as civil engineering is all 
    about bricks and mortar (not really....). For my final year project I choose "computer 
    program for calculation of forces on "composite bridge girders".
    The implementation was done using Fortran-77 and I tried to shift it to visual basic.
</p>
<p> I was also deeply interested in electronics and when I found out about 
    "8051 Microcontrollers" it got me hooked completely. I learnt more about MCUs and how
    to program them using Assembly as well as C-language. I made a simple temperature
    sensor project using LM35DZ sensor and display using 7-segment LEDs. 
    Later I programmed some stepper motors by connecting them to LPT printer port 
    of PC and controlling through MATLAB program. 
</p>
<p>
    After joining my first job as a professional civil engineer there wasn't much use of 
programming directly. My work mostly involved preparing BOQs (bill of quantities) for various civil projects in 
Excel. Always working on excel made me realise that lot of mundane tasks could be made 
easier through custom formulas. Building these formulas required understanding of basic 
coding techniques and this directly lead me towards VBA (i.e. Visual Basic for Applications). 
</p>
<p>
VBA was a fun language to learn and the best part was that I could immediately put it into use. Many simple tasks 
can be automated with VBA quite easily. I embarked upon creating my own estimation module i.e. a simple VBA module 
which will automatically gather data from various sheets and give the aggregate result and some calculations on some 
final results sheet. It was great success for me as it was my <strong> FIRST CODING / PROGRAMMING PROJECT </strong>.
</p>

<p>
Best thing that I learnt from my first project was that anything can be AUTOMATED through combination of various 
programming techniques. I learned VBA for Outlook and this helped me prepare a module for automatically saving emails
along with their attachments to their own independent folders. I also started my own "Excel Advanced" page on Facebook.
